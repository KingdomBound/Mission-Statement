    <h2>Putting The Power In The Hands Of The People</h2>
    <p>
        This is the beginning of a life focused on learning as much as I can about programming,
        cyber-security, robotics, electronics, microcontrollers, and everything else that will 
        enable me to provide valuable ideas and services to the open-source marketplace via 
        simplified, affordable plans and designs. I want to be a Full-Stack Hardware Developer!
